The Game that I am trying to develop is a Back Jack game.
JOse Damian

I think I am having Three Class that are going to be call
Black Jack, Cards and Money. I know that we already did an
black jack game in class. The Black Jack class is going to
run the game, its going to be the class that has to communicate
with all the other classes. The card class is going to have the
cards and going to shuffle them in case you want to play again.
The Money class is going to have the money its just going to
and add the money.

I couldn't get the money part to work. I just commented out the money code,
 so the other part of the game would work.
